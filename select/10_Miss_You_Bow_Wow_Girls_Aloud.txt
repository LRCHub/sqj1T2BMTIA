Everybody love, love, loves
Everybody, everybody love, love, loves
Everybody, everybody love, love, loves
Everybody, everybody loves a lover

Everybody love, love, loves
Everybody, everybody love, love, loves
Everybody, everybody love, love, loves
Everybody, everybody loves a lover

All I do, do, do, when my demons hit
I dial 999, saying get a doctor
I'm so damn tired of your shadow breaking my heart in two, oh baby
At night, when my demons hit
I dial 999, say I need a doctor
I'm so damn tired of your shadow making my heart and soul go crazy

I miss you now, now, now
You're looking bow wow, wow
I'm slipping down, down, down
I miss you now, now, now

I miss you now, now, now
You're looking bow wow, wow
I'm slipping down, down, down
I miss you now, now, now

I remember living that dream
20 minutes in a hotel bar
Then I slipped into your girlfriend's jeans
And I remember, said baby, hold tight
20 hours in the twilight zone
The only lovers in the world that night
Oh I

You're talking like you're gonna do the stupid thing
Everybody wants to see you do that thing
We're jumping in together when the bottle spins
They wanna see it stop and let the fun begin
