Gotta comb my hair
Find somethin' to wear
Where the hell are my shoes
I got no time to lose
Gotta get out now
Bow wow wow wow
Bow wow wow wow
Wild dog on the prowl
Bow wow wow wow
Hot dog on the prowl
Bow wow wow wow
Bow wow wow wow
Runnin' down the street
Through the snow and the sleet
Breath turnin' into steam
Cursin' like a cartoon dream
All the funky little things
Are gonna get me tonight
Bow wow wow wow
Wild dog on the prowl
Bow wow wow wow
Hot dog on the prowl
Bow wow wow wow
Bow wow wow wow
I gotta scratch this itch
I slip it in a little bitch
I love her hound dog style
I make her whimper and howl
When I get this way
There's only one thing I can say
Bow wow wow wow
Wild dog on the prowl
Bow wow wow wow
Hot dog on the prowl
Bow wow wow wow
Bow wow wow wow
Bow wow wow wow
Bow wow wow wow
Bow wow wow wow
Bow wow wow wow
Bow wow wow wow
Bow wow wow wow
