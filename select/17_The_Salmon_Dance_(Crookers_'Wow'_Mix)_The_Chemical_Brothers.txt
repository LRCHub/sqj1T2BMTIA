Let me introduce to you a brand new dance,
I know you're gonna love it if you give it one chance.
It's not complicated, it's not too hard,
You don't even have to be a hip hop star.
See anyone can do it, all you need is style,
Listen up peep gang, I'ma show you how:
Put your hands to the side, as silly as it seems,
And shake your body
(Shake your body, shake your body, shake your body...)
Wow
(Shake your body, shake your body, shake your body...)
Wow, wow, wow, wow...
