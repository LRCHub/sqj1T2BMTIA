Paris big city draw lines
Disgust me sometimes
Are you ready?
Living two lives
Not infinity big insanity
Called Jeopardy City kills
And rumors spread
Dress good stressful dreads
In nasty trades spread sins
Martin Luther BB kills
Basic full flavors
Dictates rules and
Behaviors knows TV shows
In order to be sure he rules
Take it or walk out
Can't deal with him 'coz he shouts:
" Desperate lost prisons
Want the last season "
Bad campaign but clients remain
Advertisings my business but I
Rely on lie tasteless: key factor success
Wonder why I like the guy looks at me
And says with a smile: I feel so sorry
All your friends gone
With the wealthy shorty

BO Let me hope
Let me open the door
To my coal
Let me clow
Is this really Mister cold

A history
With no mistery mistress understand me
I'm a player without remedy
A stranger 'coz nobody knows me
No I don't need your help
Step back and bounce again
Sincerely yours and best regards
Cold diggaz, Best regards, Cold diggaz

Ain't got good manners i thought
One day you could have stop
But you went on writing song
Go ahead in life yo yo
Catch fame and mum says no
Father blames and mum says no
Writing song but mum says no
Life is not mellow

BO Let me hope
Let me open the door
To my coal
Let me clow
Is this really Mister cold

I won't be back next morning
Last chance and first warning
What we need is what we're wanting
To get friends i'll be poking
And like a lion we'll be roaming
7th 8th grade remembering
Those used to be the days for kiddind

BO Let me hope
Let me open the door
To my coal
Let me clow
Is this really Mister cold
