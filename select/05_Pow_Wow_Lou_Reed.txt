Christopher Columbus discovered America
Found he had a cornucopia
Gave love to the indians, they gave it back
A pow woo in the teepee is where it's at
I want to dance with you
The indian fought with his arrow and bow
Till General Custer lost to Sitting Bull
Scalped all day and scalped all night
Give me fire water, gonna buy me a wife
I want to dance with you
When your people first moved to our block
Our ancestors met with culture shock
Two different monkees from two different trees
Come on let's stop our fightin' and come dance with me
I want to dance with you
